# Data Structure Learning
This is a repository used to review my studies with the main Data Structures and their characteristics and application examples. The idea behind the repository is to demonstrate the data structures in examples with some additions to the basic structure. All data structure codes written were copied/inspired by the course _"The Complete Data Structures and Algorithms Course in Python"_ by _Elshad Karimov_ available on the Udemy platform. The link to the course is https://www.udemy.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-bootcamp-in-python/

## Linked List
A linked list is a **linear data structure**, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers.

### _Introduction_
In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

###### Exemple of a one node

### _Type of Linked List_
The are some types of linked list, but the most common are:
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Linked List
